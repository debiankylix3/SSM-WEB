            <h2>Function Overview</h2>
            <p>The board offers high connectivity thanks to the numerous number of installed ports; it has I2C, Serial (UART), SPI, Wiegand, 3.5mm Jack, Ethernet, and the special ports used to access PORT A, PORT B, PORT C and PORT D of the microprocessor (for more detail check the pinout diagram). The high connectivity makes the board suitable for almost every entry-level and education scenario.</p>

            <p>The well-designed microstrip on the board that connects external modules to the board makes your professional embedded system’s wiring hassle-free. Powered by the powerful ATMega 1284p chip, this board can overcome almost every challenge in your embedded system projects. The board’s high robustness means it can withstand the outdoor operating scenario (while put in a case).</p>
